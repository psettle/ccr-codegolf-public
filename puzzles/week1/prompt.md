# Input

An integer, n
0 <= n <= 1000

n integers, x[i], 0 <= i < n
-2147483648 <= x[i] <= 2147483647

Input will be provided on the stdin stream, with a single integer on each line.

# Output

The list of integers, x[0] to x[n-1] sorted from smallest to largest.

Output should be provided on the stdout stream, with a single integer on each line.
